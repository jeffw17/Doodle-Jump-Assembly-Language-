# Doodle Jump Assembly Project

For the final project of CSC258 Computer Organization, I have recreated the famous mobile game doodle jump using MIPS Assembly language. 

You can play the game using MARS simulator (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) by simply loading the file into the simulator. 
You will need to configure the settings to match the following settings by going to Tools and select Bitmap Display:

Bitmap Display Configuration:
- Unit width in pixels: 8
- Unit height in pixels: 8
- Display width in pixels: 256
- Display height in pixels: 512
- Base Address for Display: 0x10008000 ($gp)

Then click Connect to MIPS and go to Keyboard and Display MMIO and also click Connect to MIPS. 
After doing this, simply assemble to project by clicking the assemble button and then you can start playing.
