# Doodle Jump Assembly Project

For the final project of CSC258 Computer Organization, I have recreated the famous mobile game doodle jump using MIPS Assembly language. 

You can play the game using MARS simulator (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) by simply loading the file into the simulator.
